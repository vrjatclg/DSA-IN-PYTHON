# how it works
'''
if we give it an array like [1,2,7,4,3] it will go to each index and visit and check whether
the target here 7 matches if yes it return i the index in this case if not found return -1

just like u like someone in the clg u search for the id or to talk , by going to individual class and still 
not found return a he or she seems not in this department  '''

## LINEAR SEARCH CODE


def linear_search(target,arr):
    for i,val in enumerate(arr): 
        if val==target:
            return i
    return -1
arr = [1,2,7,4,3]
target = 7
result = linear_search(target,arr)
if result!=-1:
    print(f"{target}was found at ",result)
else:
    print("not found")


# ==============================

# 💡==============================💡
# most important question why enumerate? 
# enumerate is more pythonic , it better than range(len) as it contain both value and index
#enumerate is like someone handing you both the attendance roll and the student. 
# range(len(...)) is like getting just the roll number and then hunting the student down yourself.
# 💡==============================💡

k = [1,2,3,45,6,7] #for understanding how range works it starts with 0 
for i in range(len(k)):
    print(i)
